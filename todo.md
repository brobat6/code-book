## TODO

- Make a medium-ish template. Mainly just add code that you basically have to use atleast once in a contest. Add ```int t = 1; cin >> t; while(t--) solve();```, add ```const int MOD, N```, add ```typedef vector<int> vi``` and other stuff. 

- Reimplement current code snippets in VSCode, they are a MESS. Do this later, it is lower priority. Change Mint snippet so that "Mint" doesn't just give the class but the whole starter template with Mint integration.

- Make a wrapper class for int128, it would be very useful in some operations. Having this would basically finish Python's purpose. 

- Solve https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1783/F and https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1783/E. (See next 2 points).

- Add code for bipartite matching, vertex cover, etc. Make the class detailed so it can return all of this. Add functions in the class to exactly return the vertex cover, the matching, etc, etc. 

- It's come in 3 questions in the past 10 days, so it should be added. A code that takes a number N, and returns ranges {x, y} for all values such that floor(N/i) is the same. Time complexity O(sqrt(N)). Make this general enough to solve all the 3 problems I've encountered. Maybe its best to just make a class out of it. 

- Create a snippet generator for VSCode. Files in which codes are stored can be manually contained in a file, which is opened by a python script and parsed to generate snippets file for vscode. 

- Learn multi-finger typing, maybe :)
