# code-book
This library is still in development, and will eventually contain all useful code snippets, algorithms, and math stuff for coding contests.

- **[template.cpp](template.cpp)** - My extended starter template for coding contests. Not used much, I prefer the basic 3-line template.

- **[LittleRedBook.pdf](LittleRedBook.pdf)** - ICPC code book used by our team for Regionals + Asia West finals. Forked from [KACTL](https://github.com/kth-competitive-programming/kactl).

- **[snippet-generator.py](snippet-generator.py)** - Snippet generator for VSCode, created by me. Creates code snippets of all .cpp files in this repository. 

### Graph

- **[DSU.cpp](graph/DSU.cpp)** - DSU Class (without rollback)

- **[SCC.cpp](graph/SCC.cpp)** - Class to find Strongly Connected Components of a directed graph.

### Misc

- **[NextGreaterElement.cpp](misc/NextGreaterElement.cpp)** - Function to calculate (next/previous) (greater/smaller) elements for each element in an array in $O(N)$ time.

- **[RNG.cpp](misc/RNG.cpp)** - Random Number Generator.

### Number Theory

- **[Mint.cpp](number-theory/Mint.cpp)** - Modulo Wrapper class. Can perform all basic arithmetic operations modulo a certain integer.
